### What is this?

This is the personal Jekyl page of Blake Kilraine.  I am a technical professional interested in all things operations - with a focus on virtualization, *nix administration, and infrastructure.  

### What will be posted here

I will post things here that relate to professional development.  Think of it as the soft-sides compliment to my [wiki](https://wiki.kilraine.com). 

The purpose of this page is two-fold:  A) To further develop my professional portfolio and B) to gain more use with Git as well as expose myself further to the basic fundamentals of web development and hosting.
