### What is this?

This is the personal Jekyl page of Blake Kilraine.  I am a young technical professional interested in all things operations - with a focus on virtualization, *nix administration, and infrastructure.

### What will be posted here

I will post things here that relate to professional development.  These posts will be shorter and less in-depth than posts on my [wiki](wiki.kilraine.com) page.  The purpose of this page is two-fold:  A) To further develop my professional portfolio and B) to gain more use with Git as well as expose myself to the basic fundamentals of web development and hosting.
